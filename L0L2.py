For demonstration, we first generate a synthetic regression dataset (X,y)
as follows: y = X*b + epsilon, where the true vector of coefficients b
is sparse and has only 10 nonzero entries.
We set the number of samples n=1000 and number of features p=10,000.

Run L0BnB to solve the problem for a sequence of lambda_0's.
By default, the sequence of lambda_0's is automatically chosen by the toolkit.
Use max_nonzeros=10 to stop the regularization path when it exceeds 10 nonzeros.
Here we fix lambda_2 = 0.01 (generally, this is data-dependent).

sols = fit_path(X, y, lambda_2 = 0.01, max_nonzeros = 10)

"""
sols is a list of solutions, each corresponding to a different lambda_0.
Below we inspect the solution with index 4.
The estimated coefficients vector "b_estimated" and the intercept term can be accessed as follows:
"""
b_estimated = sols[4]["B"] # a numpy array.
intercept = sols[4]["B0"]

# To check the nonzero indices in b_estimated:
print("Nonzero indices in b_estimated: ", np.nonzero(b_estimated)[0])
# The nonzero indices in b_estimated match that of b.

# Predictions on the training data can be made as follows:
y_estimated = np.dot(X, b_estimated) + intercept
