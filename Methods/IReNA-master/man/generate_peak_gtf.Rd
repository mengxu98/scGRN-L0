\title{Merge peak and generate gft}
\usage{
generate_peak_gtf(peak, peak_half_width = 250)
}
\arguments{
\item{peak}{data.frame, indicating peaks file. If you call peak for each sample separately, you need to combine these peaks firstly through cbind().}

\item{peak_half_width}{numeric, indicating half of peak width}
}
\value{
return peaks related gtf file
}
\description{
Merge the peaks that are close to each other and modify the length of the peak to 2*(peak_half_width). Finally, return peaks related gtf file
}
\examples{
load(system.file("extdata", "test_peak.rda", package = "IReNA"))
peaks <- test_peak[,c(1,2,3)]
gtf <- generate_gtf(peaks)
